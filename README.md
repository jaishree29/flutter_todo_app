# ToDo List App

I'm excited to share my first Flutter project with you! It's a simple yet functional Todo List app that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed using checkboxes. Plus, it utilizes local storage to ensure that your tasks are saved even after closing and reopening the app.

## Getting Started

Here are some code snippets and screenshots:
